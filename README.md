# User Story
As a food enthusiast, I want to be able to see proven recipes that I can use, store some of my own recipes that I may have forgotten certain elements of, and share them to my community. 

Each new user will be able create an account by providing a name, email address, and password. 

Once signed in, the user will land on their profile page page of the app. The user will have options to delete their account, update their info, or get started and create a new recipe! 

When creating a new recipe, the user will fill in the name, cuisine, cook time, ingredients, and instructions of the recipe. 

Once created, the recipe will be shown in the recipe list page. The user can navigate to other recipes made by other users and update or delete those recipes. Each recipe made by the user will also be shown in the user profile page.
